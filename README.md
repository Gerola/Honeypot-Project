# Honeypot (In Progress)
This is a honeypot project that supports the following protocols.
- SSH

## Run as SSH

## Run as HTTP
To Run ` python3 insert_command ` <br><br>
The HTTP part of the honeypot should have two pages available when started. The login and registration page. It should default to the login page when going to the webpage. When data is entered and submitted for either page, the data submitted will be written to the text file {insertNameFile}. It will log the username, password, IP, time and for the registration page the email the client entered.
